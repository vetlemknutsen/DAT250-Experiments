### Second example

### Own function 
![](images/own_function.png)

This function is useful as it analyzes customer purchasing by finding the customers who ordered multiple items. 
Also, it could show which customers shops the most. 


## Technical problems

Installing MongoDB went okay, but without MongoDB compass I got a bit confused as to how to use it. 
Also, encountered a problem during experiment 2, where I tried to do it in local as experiment 2, but that didn't work. 
Changed to a new database.
