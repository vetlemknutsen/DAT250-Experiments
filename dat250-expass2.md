## Report experiment 2 DAT250

In this report i will go through the different steps to explain what i have done. 

First of all, an interesting experiment. It was challenging and a bit tricky. 

### Step 0
I chose to use Bruno, as I was not familiar with that program and it was used in the lectures. It was easy to download 
and set up.

### Step 1
Used the same repository as first assignment

### Step 2
I started by creating simple Java beans for User, Vote, Poll and VoteOption. Here I had to make some choices, like what 
properties the beans should have. 
For Poll, I chose to include:
* ID for identification
* String for the question 
* Instant for the publish date 
* Instant for valid date 
* User-object for user
* Arraylist of options.
