## Report experiment 3 DAT250

In this report i will go through the different steps to explain what i have done. 
This was a fun experiment and I learnt a lot about connecting backend and frontend.

### Step 1 
Node.js and NPM were already installed.
I created the frontend project with
```
npm init vite@latest
```
I encountered a problem her because in the task description there was a spelling error. 
And since I just copied the command I didn't notice it, and I got an error. 

Next, I chose to use Svelte since I hadn't used this before and wanted to try it. 
This set up part went well. 

### Step 2
I did some research about how to create components in Javascript and Svelte, and made three classes: 
CreatePollComponent, CreateUserComponent and VoteComponent. They were going to handle poll creation, user creating and voting respectively.
I started by just creating simple user interfaces which I could continue working on in later steps.
<br>CreateUserComponent ended up looking like this:

VoteComponent:

CreatePollComponent:

I could have used more time on the CSS, but didn't find it necessary for this project.
